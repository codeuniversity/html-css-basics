<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is a doctype. Every HTML file should have one.
Basically you only need this one nowadays, as this means HTML5 (what you're learning here)
for modern browsers but old browsers still pick up that your file is some kind of HTML.-->

<html>
<!-- Here the HTML starts, so we put an opening <html> tag here. -->

  <head>
    <!-- The title of the page. That's what appears in the browser's title bar.
    It also appears as the clickable text on search engine results. -->
    <title>Our Page Title</title>

    <!-- We set the character set of the document. UTF-8 is typically used. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <!-- The description says in a few sentences what the page contains.
     This text appears as part of a listing in search engine results. -->
    <meta name="description" content="Nomadcruise 2015 – floating to Brazil with fun & ease with 150 digital nomads.">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css">
    <!-- Here we tell the document what CSS stylesheet to use.
    You can define mutliple files by using multiple <link> tags. -->
  </head>
  <!-- And we close our <head> element and open the <body>, where the actual content goes. -->

  <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here… -->
  </body>

</html>
<!-- And in the end we close the <body> and <html> tag. -->
